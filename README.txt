********** DELETE EACH TASK WHEN FINISHED **********
    TASKS !!!!
    - Edit our Algorithms
        - Both Algorithms are written out still needs to be tested
    - Player UI
        - Map
            - When the 'k' key is pressed, a new miniature window, "MAP" should now appear
            - User should be able to select with algorithm to use (BFS or DFS)
            - Map should contain positions of the following:
                - Player position
                - obstacle positions
                - home position
            - We must show how the algorithms work, be shading in the pixels in the Map
                - similar to how the GTA project worked
            - (OPTIONAL) after best route is found, shade the actual blocks on the actual world to help
    - OPTIONAL (WORK ON THIS LAST)
        - music (default minecraft music)
        - block effects
            - water -> player speed + 5
            - lava -> player speed - 5
